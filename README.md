Analysis pipelines and exploratory notebooks developed for the ASH Variant Platform, supporting cohort-scale variant interpretation in hematologic malignancies.

### ASH Variant Platform — Analysis Pipelines

*Global Hematologic Malignancies*

This repository contains analysis pipelines and exploratory notebooks developed in the context of the **ASH Variant Platform**, a global reference initiative focused on variant interpretation in hematologic malignancies.

The work reflects methods used to support **cohort-scale genomic analysis**, variant clustering, and data visualization across large, heterogeneous cancer datasets.

### Project Context

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) Variant Platform was conceived as a **global reference resource** for consistent interpretation of hematologic disease variants across institutions and geographies.

The broader platform integrates data from major public and institutional resources, including:

* cBioPortal
* NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC)
* COSMIC
* Population-scale and disease-specific genomic cohorts

This repository captures **analysis components and pipelines** developed during that effort, with an emphasis on scalability, interpretability, and clinical relevance.

### Contents

This repository includes:

* Exploratory notebooks for **dimensionality reduction and cohort visualization** (e.g., t-SNE–based analyses)
* Variant-level and cohort-level analysis workflows
* Supporting code for data preprocessing and feature extraction
* Prototype analyses used to evaluate differentiation approaches for variant interpretation at scale

> Note: Data inputs in this repository are either synthetic, de-identified, or representative examples. This repo does not contain protected or proprietary datasets.

### Design Principles

The pipelines in this repository were developed with the following principles in mind:

* **Cohort-first analysis** rather than single-variant inspection
* **Clinical interpretability** alongside statistical rigor
* **Scalability** to population-scale genomic datasets
* **Reproducibility** across institutions and research environments

### Intended Use

This repository is intended for:

* Researchers exploring cohort-level variant patterns in hematologic malignancies
* Data scientists working with large-scale cancer genomics datasets
* Product, platform, or translational teams evaluating reference-model approaches to variant interpretation

### Disclaimer

This repository represents **analytical and exploratory work** from a larger platform initiative and is not a complete production system. The views and implementations here are for research and demonstration purposes only.

If you want, I can:

* Tighten this into a **more technical / less narrative** README
* Rewrite it to sound **more academic** or **more product/platform-oriented**
* Add a **“How to run”** section based on the actual notebooks in the repo
* Tailor it for **recruiter-facing**, **open-source**, or **portfolio** positioning

Just tell me the vibe you’re aiming for.
